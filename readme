Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.
None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was challenging, but useful. I had to pay attention to details I’d normally 
overlook, especially with parent–child invariants and ordering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?
I found it helpful for understanding how data structures break in subtle ways.
I also learnt a lot on using gdb to debug.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

None

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

      checkerDT.c: (in function CheckerDT_Node_isValid)
checkerDT.c:182:24: Index of null pointer names: names
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced.  Value is either the result of a
  function which may return null (in which case, code should check it is not
  null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the null
  qualifier. (Use -nullderef to inhibit warning)

  Splint thinks names might be NULL, but in our code it’s only indexed after
  we verify allocation succeeded. It’s a false positive and safe to ignore

your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."


   checkerDT.c: line 29: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 's' through an assert?

   I intentionally did not add an assert(s != NULL) because the function
   is designed to safely handle NULL input by returning NULL. Adding
   an assert would break that intended behavior.

ft.c: line 329: low priority: 
   A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
   this loop consists of 44 lines; consider refactoring
   
   The loop is intentionally long because it performs several required 
   operations in sequence, and splitting it would reduce clarity rather
   than improve structure.

ft.c: line 663: low priority: 
   A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
   this file contains 17 functions

   The File Tree API contains many separate operations (insert, remove, 
   contains, stat, replace, toString, etc.).
   Each function directly corresponds to a distinct public API requirement, 
   so splitting the file would fragment the implementation.

ft.c: line 269: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?   

   pvContents may legally be NULL for zero-length files.

ft.c: line 515: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert? 

   File contents may validly be NULL.
   
ft.c: line 662: low priority: 
   A source code file should contain fewer than 500 lines;
   this file contains 663 lines
   
   The implementation is long because the FT abstraction requires 
   multiple complex operations, each with explicit error checking 
   and prefix/path handling. Breaking the file into smaller files 
   would reduce readability and violate the intended module structure.

nodeFT.c: line 83: low priority: 
   A function should consist of fewer than 140 lines;
   this function consists of 148 lines; consider refactoring
      
   Every line is necessarily included.
   
nodeFT.c: line 83: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
   
   May be legally NULL for zero-length files.

   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
   
   May be legally NULL for zero-length files.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

dtBad1a / nodeDTBad1a

Critique:
Incorrect initialization state handling (ulCount bug). ulCount was never initialized.
ulCount becomes garbage (wraps to −1), causing CheckerDT_isValid() to fail.
This violates the invariant that when bIsInitialized is FALSE, ulCount must be 0 
and root must be NULL.

dtBad1b / nodeDTBad1b

Critique:
dtBad1b breaks the parent–child path prefix invariant.
The child’s path does not correctly extend the parent’s path.

dtBad2 / nodeDTBad2

Critique:
Duplicate child names under the same parent are not prevented.

 dtBad3 / nodeDTBad3

Critique:
dtBad3 stores children out of lexicographic order.

dtBad4 / nodeDTBad4

Critique:
dtBad4 has an incorrect node count.
ulCount does not match the actual number of nodes reachable from the root.
