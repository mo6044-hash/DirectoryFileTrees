(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None 

(warnings from repurposing the DT code)

What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        int BDT_insert(const char *pcPath)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        static int BDT_addChild(struct node *psParent, 
                                                 struct node *psChild)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        int BDT_toString()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

* rather than using bIsInitialized, oNRoot and ulCount as static global variables,
we could have them inside a struct DT and use an opaque pointer to allow for creation
of several independent directory trees

* We could split the functionality of dt.c into separate files eg one handling the tree traversal
and nodes and another handling the tree building and managing memory to avoid having all the 
functions in one .c file
